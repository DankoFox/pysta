## Role of `file_size` in a Torrent System

### Tracker Server Metadata

When a node queries the tracker server about a file, the server provides metadata such as:
- **Total `file_size`**
- **`piece_size`** (size of each chunk)
- **`piece_hashes`** (hashes for verifying pieces)
- **List of peers** with the file or specific pieces of it.

This metadata allows the client to:
- **Initialize** the download process.
- **Allocate space** for the file.
- **Validate** the data received for each piece.

### Why `file_size` is Critical

- **Determine Last Piece Size**: The `file_size` is essential to compute the size of the last piece, which is often smaller than the `piece_size`.
- **Validation**: Knowing the total size ensures that the entire file is received and reconstructed correctly.
- **Allocation**: Some implementations pre-allocate disk space for the file, requiring the `file_size`.

## Integration into Your System

If your `DownloadManager` is part of a torrent-like application, the following flow would apply:

### Request Metadata from Tracker Server

When a node expresses interest in downloading a file, it sends a request to the tracker. The tracker responds with:
- **`file_size`**
- **`piece_size`**
- **`piece_hashes`**
- **Peer list**

### Initialize DownloadManager

The `DownloadManager` is instantiated using this metadata:

```python
download_manager = DownloadManager(file_path, piece_size, piece_hashes, file_size)
```
## Download and Validation

The DownloadManager uses file_size to:
- Track progress.
- Verify that all pieces are downloaded and assembled correctly.

## Practical Example

Here's how the metadata might be sent and processed in a tracker-server interaction:

### Tracker Server Response (Simulated JSON)

```json
{
  "file_size": 4584,
  "piece_size": 20,
  "piece_hashes": [
    "88df315b73e1961ca3c7f2cfcc26d74a733dd03314d099513de4f0309ef41178",
    "6bc61e294b7537b79b0642e7700d44149e34f179f6d7590144ccdb204f3bbf86",
    "...additional hashes..."
  ],
  "peers": [
    {"ip": "127.0.0.1", "port": 6881},
    {"ip": "127.0.0.2", "port": 6882}
  ]
}
```

## Client Request Flow:

**Request Metadata:**

```python
metadata = tracker_server.request_file_metadata("file_identifier")
```

**Initialize DownloadManager:**

```python
file_path = "path_to_downloaded_file"  
piece_size = metadata["piece_size"]  
file_size = metadata["file_size"]  
piece_hashes = metadata["piece_hashes"]
download_manager = DownloadManager(file_path, piece_size, piece_hashes, file_size)
```

**Start Download:**

```python
peers = metadata["peers"]  
for peer in peers:  
    download_manager.start_download((peer["ip"], peer["port"]))
```
